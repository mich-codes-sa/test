# Git commands

This file is intended to serve as a reference document while I get into the habit of interacting with git for version control. I will be using the commands given while I followed the Tech With Tim tutorial at the following URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVRQoVRzMIY

git commit -m "include a comment as to why you're commiting this."
    commits the changes to the repo  
git push origin new
    sends the commit to the external repo  
git pull
